# Compilers Tests

A collaboartive repo containing tests for the COMP207p compilers module. Includes a python script to run every test against your compiled lexer and parser and writes the output to result.csv
If you use this repo please add any of your own test cases that at least use the naming convention n-<fileName>.s for files that should fail and p-<fileName>.s for files that should pass.
