# Compilers Tests

A collaborative repo containing tests for the COMP207p compilers module. Includes a python script to run every test against your compiled lexer and parser.
If you use this repo please add any of your own test cases that at least use the naming convention n-<fileName>.s for files that should fail and p-<fileName>.s for files that should pass.

We are not sure if all of these tests are correct since we might have made different assumptions.
